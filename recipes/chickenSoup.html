    Ingredients
  </h2>
  <h3>Chicken Soup</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil or olive oil
    <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
    <li>1 rib celery, chopped</li>
    <li>1 carrot, peeled and chopped</li>
    <li>1 carrot, peeled and chopped</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
    <li>1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
    <li> ½ cup white rice</li>
    <li>8 cups of Chicken Bone Broth (from above)</li>
    <li> ½ teaspoons fine sea salt
      ½ teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
      Minced fresh parsley for garnish
    </li>

  </ul>
  <h3>Steps to Assemble:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Pressure cook the chicken broth for 60 minutes: (See my Instant Pot Chicken Broth for a detailed recipe.) Add
      the chicken backs, onion, celery, carrot, bay leaf, and salt to an Instant Pot or other pressure cooker, then add
      the water. (It should cover the chicken backs - if it doesn't, add water to cover or up to the max fill line on
      the pressure cooker). Lock the lid and pressure cook on high pressure for 60 minutes in an Instant Pot (or other
      electric pressure cooker) or 50 minutes in a stovetop PC. Let the pressure come down naturally – about 30 minutes.
      (It takes a long time for all that water to cool off. If you're in a hurry, let the pressure come down for at
      least 20 minutes, then quick release any remaining pressure.) Scoop the bones and vegetables out of the pot with a
      slotted spoon and discard. Strain the broth through a [fine mesh strainer] and discard the solids. Reserve 8 cups
      of broth for the soup, and refrigerate or freeze the rest for another use.</li>
    <li>Sauté the aromatics: Wipe out the pressure cooker pot liner, then put it back in the pressure cooker base. Add
      the vegetable oil and heat over sauté mode - medium until shimmering, about 3 minutes. (Use medium heat for a
      stovetop PC.) Add the onion, celery, and carrot, and sprinkle with ½ teaspoon of salt and the thyme. Sauté,
      stirring occasionally, until the onions soften and turn translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the cubed chicken
      breast, then stir in the rice.</li>
    <li>Pressure cook the soup for 4 minutes with a 10-minute Natural Release: Add the 8 cups of chicken broth to the
      pot, lock the lid on the pot, and pressure cook for 4 minutes on high pressure (use the same timing for both
      electric and stovetop PCs). Let the pressure come down naturally for 10 minutes, then quick release the rest. (If
      the released steam starts to sputter and spit out starch, shut the valve and let the pressure come down for
      another 5 minutes before quickly releasing again.)
    </li>
    <li>Season and serve: Unlock the lid on the pressure cooker, and stir in 1½ teaspoons of salt and the fresh ground
      pepper. Serve and enjoy!
    </li>
