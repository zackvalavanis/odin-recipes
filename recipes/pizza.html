  <h2>
    Ingredients
  </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>¼ cup (2 ounces) warm water (110° to 115°F)</li>
    <li>2¼ teaspoons active dry yeast or 1¾ teaspoons </li>
    <li>3¼ cups (16¼ ounces) bread flour or unbleached all-purpose flour </li>
    <li>1 cup (8 ounces) water</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons (1 ½ ounces) extra virgin olive oil, plus 1 tablespoon for brushing</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps to Assemble:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Place the warm water in a small bowl and sprinkle with the yeast. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand for 5
      minutes or until foamy. Stir to dissolve, if necessary.</li>
    <li>In a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the flour and salt and mix briefly to combine. Turn the mixer
      on low speed, add the yeast mixture and mix to combine. Add the water and 3 tablespoons of olive oil and knead the
      dough until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Alternatively, you can knead the dough by hand on a floured
      surface for about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Shape the dough into a smooth ball, place it on a floured surface and cover with an inverted bowl, plastic wrap
      or a damp cloth. Let rise at room temperature for about 1½ hours, or until doubled in bulk.</li>
    <li>About 30 minutes before baking the pizza, place a pizza stone on the lowest rack in the oven and preheat the
      oven to 500°F.</li>
    <li>
      When the dough is ready, use a large knife or a bench scraper to divide it into 4 equal pieces. With lightly
      floured hands, press out any bubbles that might have formed in the dough and form each piece into a small smooth
      ball. Place about 4 inches apart on a lightly floured surface and, when your grill is preheated and ready to go,
      roll out the dough and add toppings on the grill.</li>
  </ol>
